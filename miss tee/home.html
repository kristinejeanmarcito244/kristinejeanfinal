    <p>Having education in an area helps people think, feel, and behave in a way that contributes to their success,</br>
       and improves not only their personal satisfaction but also their community. In addition, education develops human personality,</br>
        thoughts, dealing with others and prepares people for life experiences.</p>
    <p>It makes people have a special status in their own society and everywhere they live in. I believe that everyone is entitled </br>
      to have education ‘’from cradle to grave’’. There are various benefits of having education such as having a good career, </br>
      having a good status in society, and having self-confidence. First of all, education gives us the chance of having a good career </br>
      in our life. We can have plenty of chances to work at any workplace we wish. In other words, opportunities for a better employment </br>
      can be more and easy. The highly educated we are the better chance we get. Moreover, education polishes our mind, reinforces</br>
      our thoughts, and strengthens our character and behaviors toward others. It equips us with information in various fields in</br>
      general and our specialization in particular; especially what we need to master in our job career. Therefore, without education</br>
      we may not survive properly nor have a decent profession. Furthermore, education grants us a good status in society.</br>
      As educated people, we are considered as a valuable source of knowledge for our society. Having education helps us teach </br>
      others morals, manners and ethics in our society. For this reason, people deal with us in a considerable and special way </br>
      for being productive and resourceful. In addition, education makes us a role model in society when our people need us to </br>
      guide them to the right way or when they want to take a decision. Thus, it is an honor for us to serve our community and</br>
      contribute towards its advancement. In fact, being educated is an advantage to help our people and build a good society. </br>
      Besides, it is very well-known that having self-confidence is always generated from education. It is a great blessing for </br>
      us to have self-confidence which leads to many advantages and success in life. For example, it helps us manage specific tasks, </br>
      tackle life’s challenges and maintain positive stands. Additionally, having self-confidence is typically based on proper </br>
      education; paving the path for us to success. Accordingly, self-confidence makes us aware of how well we perform a task or</br>
      a range of actions. In short, being educated is undoubtedly being self-confident and successful in life. All in all,</br>
      education is the process of acquiring knowledge and information that lead to a successful future. As discussed above,</br>
      there are a lot of positive traits of having education; such as having a good career, having a good status in society,</br>
      and having self-confidence. Education makes us view obstacles as challenges to overcome with no fear; facing new things. </br>
      It is the main factor behind successful people and the merit of developed countries.</br>+
       Therefore, education is deemed a real success behind any future success.</p>
